# Midterm Proposal Presentation Schedule

Today you will be presenting your midterm proposals to your classmates. Please be respectful of your fellow students and keep your laptops closed while listening to presentations. Each presentation should take 5-7 minutes including questions and comments. 

### Midterm Project is 25% of your final grade. Consider it like a 3 week homework assignment. Midterm Presentations will take place Week 7. (The week before spring break).

** All proposals are due the first class of Week 5. We will be using a simple javascript function to shuffle your names and choose presentation order at the beginning of class so be prepared! **

##PSA: We do not have class Monday due to Presidents Day. 
Week 6 we will be learning image optimization in Photoshop. Please have at the very least a trail version of Adobe Photoshop CC installed on your machines before class next week.
